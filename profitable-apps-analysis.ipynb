[We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app]. My goal is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n\n\n\n## Opening and Exploring the Data\n\n\n\nAs of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.\n\n\n\n<center>\n\n![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/350/py1m8_statista.png)\n\nSource: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/)\n\n</center>\n\n\n\nCollecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so I'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, I should first try to see whether I can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for this purpose:\n\n\n\n- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n\n- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store.

Only 3.66% of the apps are designed for education, followed by social networking apps which amount for 3.29% of the apps in the data set.\n\n\n\nThe general impression is that App Store (at least the part containing free English apps) is dominated by apps that are designed for fun (games, entertainment, photo and video, social networking, sports, music, etc.), while apps with practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle, etc.) are more rare. However, the fact that fun apps are the most numerous doesn't also imply that they also have the greatest number of users — the demand might not be the same as the offer.\n\n\n\nLet's continue by examining the `Genres` and `Category` columns of the Google Play data set (two columns which seem to be related).","metadata":{"id":"PJ46gVj1dw4G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_table(android_final, 1) # Category","metadata":{"id":"OjWHtqPIdw4H","outputId":"1a7ee405-4f72-4086-9120-4256f8a6dfc0","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.843105Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.843454Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.861630Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.843421Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.860413Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"FAMILY : 18.907942238267147\nGAME : 9.724729241877256\nTOOLS : 8.461191335740072\nBUSINESS : 4.591606498194946\nLIFESTYLE : 3.9034296028880866\nPRODUCTIVITY : 3.892148014440433\nFINANCE : 3.7003610108303246\nMEDICAL : 3.531137184115524\nSPORTS : 3.395758122743682\nPERSONALIZATION : 3.3167870036101084\nCOMMUNICATION : 3.2378158844765346\nHEALTH_AND_FITNESS : 3.0798736462093865\nPHOTOGRAPHY : 2.944494584837545\nNEWS_AND_MAGAZINES : 2.7978339350180503\nSOCIAL : 2.6624548736462095\nTRAVEL_AND_LOCAL : 2.33528880866426\nSHOPPING : 2.2450361010830324\nBOOKS_AND_REFERENCE : 2.1435018050541514\nDATING : 1.861462093862816\nVIDEO_PLAYERS : 1.7937725631768955\nMAPS_AND_NAVIGATION : 1.3989169675090252\nFOOD_AND_DRINK : 1.2409747292418771\nEDUCATION : 1.1620036101083033\nENTERTAINMENT : 0.9589350180505415\nLIBRARIES_AND_DEMO : 0.9363718411552346\nAUTO_AND_VEHICLES : 0.9250902527075812\nHOUSE_AND_HOME : 0.8235559566787004\nWEATHER : 0.8009927797833934\nEVENTS : 0.7107400722021661\nPARENTING : 0.6543321299638989\nART_AND_DESIGN : 0.6430505415162455\nCOMICS : 0.6204873646209386\nBEAUTY : 0.5979241877256317\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The landscape seems significantly different on Google Play: there are not that many apps designed for fun, and it seems that a good number of apps are designed for practical purposes (family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.).

One thing I could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where I could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, I could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n\n\n\nThis idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n\n\n\nOther genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea I described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to me:\n\n\n\n- Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require me to connect these apps to non-free APIs.\n\n\n\n- Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of the goal.\n\n\n\n- Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and I don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.\n\n\n\nNow let's analyze the Google Play market a bit.\n\n\n\n## Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play\n\n\n\nFor the Google Play market, I actually have data about the number of installs, so I should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — I can see that most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.):","metadata":{"id":"RClnbNGSdw4d"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_table(android_final, 5) # the Installs columns","metadata":{"id":"k9XN-3Oxdw4e","outputId":"4cf0acfe-8452-4c92-e400-c0c0879ebe1c","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.954906Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.955273Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.972866Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.955206Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-30T18:47:11.971759Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"1,000,000+ : 15.726534296028879\n100,000+ : 11.552346570397113\n10,000,000+ : 10.548285198555957\n10,000+ : 10.198555956678701\n1,000+ : 8.393501805054152\n100+ : 6.915613718411552\n5,000,000+ : 6.825361010830325\n500,000+ : 5.561823104693141\n50,000+ : 4.7721119133574\n5,000+ : 4.512635379061372\n10+ : 3.5424187725631766\n500+ : 3.2490974729241873\n50,000,000+ : 2.3014440433213\n100,000,000+ : 2.1322202166064983\n50+ : 1.917870036101083\n5+ : 0.78971119133574\n1+ : 0.5076714801444043\n500,000,000+ : 0.2707581227436823\n1,000,000,000+ : 0.22563176895306858\n0+ : 0.04512635379061372\n0 : 0.01128158844765343\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One problem with this data is that is not precise.

Moreover, these niches seem to be dominated by a few giants who are hard to compete against.\n\n\n\nThe game genre seems pretty popular, but previously I found out this part of the market seems a bit saturated, so I'd like to come up with a different app recommendation if possible.\n\n\n\nThe books and reference genre looks fairly popular as well, with an average number of installs of 8,767,811. It's interesting to explore this in more depth, since I found this genre has some potential to work well on the App Store, and my aim is to recommend an app genre that shows potential for being profitable on both the App Store and Google Play.\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at some of the apps from this genre and their number of installs:","metadata":{"id":"VGf0n6cydw5A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for app in android_final:\n\n    if app[1] == 'BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE':\n\n        print(app[0], ':', app[5])","metadata":{"id":"EsjrE2Nudw5B","outputId":"04f55ee7-8355-412d-c43b-8f3b3ebd4db4","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-30T18:47:12.111164Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-30T18:47:12.111638Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-30T18:47:12.130275Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-30T18:47:12.111580Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-30T18:47:12.128980Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"E-Book Read -
